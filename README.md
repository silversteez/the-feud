The Feud
================
The Feud is a massively-multiplayer Family Feud game with dynamically generated survey data. The server maintains the state of the game (new question and answer cycles every 30 seconds) and all clients are synchronized via websocket connections.

The front-end can be built as an iOS or Android app (via Phonegap), but in its current state is served as a website. The Phonegap-wrapped front-end repo is located [here](http://github.com/silversteez/question-game-pg).
